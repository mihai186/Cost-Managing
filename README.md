# Cost-Managing
Developed a user-centric web application aimed at facilitating economical purchasing decisions. The application allows users to input their buying information and provides them with the tools to assess the utility of their purchases. By empowering users to actively participate in the decision-making process, they can make more informed choices aligned with their needs and budget.
In addition, the application features a visually engaging charts tab that enables users to compare their buying habits and product categories between any two months. This feature provides users with valuable insights into their spending patterns, allowing them to identify areas for improvement and make more financially conscious decisions.

You can access the main page of the web app by opening the index.html file. This serves as the home page, providing general information about the app. By selecting the "Introducere date" tab, a page will open where you can enter the details of your purchased products, including their cost, category, and description.

The data is stored using JS local storage as a JSON string (please note that it may not work on certain browsers). In the "Listă" tab, if the storage function is functioning properly (except for Firefox, where it might not work), you will find a list of all the products you have entered. From there, you have the option to delete items or change their category to "inutil" (of no use).

In the "Evoluție" tab, if you have entered at least one product, you will find two charts that allow you to compare your spending between two months. These charts provide valuable insights into your financial habits.

Lastly, the "Informații suplimentare" tab contains additional useful information about the tool, as well as some financing details.
