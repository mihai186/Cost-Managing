# Cost-Managing
Developed a user-centric web application aimed at facilitating economical purchasing decisions. The application allows users to input their buying information and provides them with the tools to assess the utility of their purchases. By empowering users to actively participate in the decision-making process, they can make more informed choices aligned with their needs and budget.
In addition, the application features a visually engaging charts tab that enables users to compare their buying habits and product categories between any two months. This feature provides users with valuable insights into their spending patterns, allowing them to identify areas for improvement and make more financially conscious decisions.

You can access the main page of the web app opening the index.html file. This is the home page in which you can find out general info about the app.
If you press the "Introducere date" tab, a page will be opened in which you will put in your bought products, aling with their cost and category and description. The data are stored using JS local storage as a JSON string (it might not work on some browsers).
In the "Listă" tab, if there hasnt been a problem with storing (for example on Firefox it doesn't work), there should be a list of all products introduced. You can delete or change category of the products to "inutil" (of no use).
In the "Evoluție" tab, if you put in at least a product, there will appear two charts used to compare your spendings between two months.
In the "Informații suplimentare" tab there are more usefull info of the tool and some financing information.
